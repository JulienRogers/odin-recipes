    <h3 class="sub title">Cherry Tomato and Feta Tik Tok Pasta</h3>
    <p>This is the story about another viral TikTok trend that I kinda sorted wanted to hate...but didn't. It's not that I didn't think the idea sounded delicious. It's just that the whole thing seemed too simple. Obviously roasting a block of feta with bursting tomatoes is going to be amazing. But is it good enough to break the internet? 
    <p>My answer, begrudgingly, is yes. It's genius. But dare I say, not perfect? Below are my thoughts. </p>
    <h3 class="sub title">The easiest ingredients list in the world?</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 pt. cherry or grape tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 shallot, quartered</li>
        <li>1/2cup olive oil</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>generous pinch of crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 8oz block feta</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>10oz. pasta</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>*don't feel like that was the easiest ingredient list ever? The original only calls for 
        the cherry tomatoes, olive oil, feta, pasta and basil. But I encourage you to
        be creative and make this meal more wholesome with your favourite add-ins.

    <h3 class="sub title">Directions</h3>
    <ol id="directions">
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°. In a large cast iron skillet or medium baking dish, 
            combine tomatoes, shallot, garlic, and all but 1 tablespoon oil. Season with 
            salt and red pepper flakes and toss to combine. </li>
        <li>Place feta into center of tomato mixture and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. 
            Scatter thyme sprigs over tomatoes. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until 
            tomatoes are bursting and feta is golden on top. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente 
            according to package directions. Reserve ½ cup pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>To skillet with tomatoes and feta, add cooked pasta, reserved pasta water, 
            and lemon zest (if using) and stir until combined. Garnish with basil. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
