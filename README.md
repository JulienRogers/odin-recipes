HTML project for Odin

Completing a lesson project for The Odin Project foundations course on 
how to use HTML. By the end of the lesson I will demonstrate the 
knowledge I have gained so far and practice writing HTML. The project is
to build a basic recipe website. It will consist of a main index page
which will have links to a few recipes. It will not be pretty but will
be revisited later using CSS.
